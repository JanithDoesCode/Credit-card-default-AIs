# Credit Card Default Prediction AI

This project is an **AI-powered machine learning model** that predicts whether a customer is likely to default on their credit card payment next month based on financial and demographic features.

## Project Overview

- Developed using **Random Forest Classifier** with hyperparameter tuning using **RandomizedSearchCV**.
- Preprocessed data by encoding categorical variables and standardizing numeric values.
- Achieved high accuracy and interpretability through model visualization and feature analysis.
- Model trained and saved using **Pickle** for future predictions.
